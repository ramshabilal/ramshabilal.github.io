30 Minute Film Festival Website

Project Name: 30 Minute Film Festival Website - Life of the NYUAD Cats  

Project Description:  
The project is a website about the campus cats at New York University Abu Dhabi. The campus cats are a unique and adorable feature of the NYUAD campus and are 
definitely famous as well. From having an instagram page to posts in NYUAD's newspaper, the Gazelle, these cats are loved by all. Each cat has a name too! Thus, it 
is safe to say that the students at NYUAD hold the campus cats very dear to them, and people from around the globe have noticed our furry little friends. So, this 
project aims to represent these cats and give them a voice.   
The goal of the website is to create a fun, interactive, and relaxing experience for any user who visits the page. Special focus was placed on the following during the development of the site:  
- creating a user-friendly website which is easy to use and navigate - no complex features - each button, heading, media content etc. is placed in a way that makes it easy for the user to view, understand, and enjoy
- using interactivity to engage the viewer:  
          -> the home page has text that appears when mouse enters the heading and when the screen is scrolled, so that the user feels engaged    
          -> there is a like button that changes color so user can like and unlike the video  
          -> the link buttons that link home page to the about and team pages change appearance when mouse hovers over them and can be clicked to jump to the other pages  
          -> the header (with NYU Abu Dhabi written on it) is a sticky element so it hovers over the screen top even when the user scrolls down so that the user always has access to all the pages 
- using colors, fonts, aesthetics, and arranging content in a way that make the site visually appealing, engaging, and fun to view - i.e. the user does not have to concentrate too much to get what the site is about  
- storytelling: I wanted to convey what the film festival is, what the video is about, who was behind the lens when making the video, and what is the life of an NYUAD cat
- presenting my creativity and expressing myself through this website
    
Implementation:  
To implement my concept and ideas, I used html, css, and javascript to build my website. Video tutorials, GitHub examples, and class lectures were used to develop the website from scratch. Some features used in the site include:  
- Cascading Style Sheet: classes, fonts, position, height-width, margins, padding, shadows, text features, tables, colors, background features, position, transitions, opacity, etc  
- HTML: divs, images, video embedding, spans, links, breaks, paragraphs, inline-styling, etc   
- Javascript: Event listeners (click, scroll, hover, visibility, transitions, etc.)  
Using these features, I implemented the ideas in my initial wireframe and my goals as mentioned above to make a live website   

Reflection/Evaluation:  
Creating my very first website was a very fun experience and I learned a lot in the process. Firstly, it turned out to be a much more enjoyable as well as complex process than I had imagined and it was something that allowed me to not only begin learning a very important skill in UI/UX design, but to also be creative and express myself. Working in teams to shoot the video and edit it and then present it was also a unique and memorable aspect that helped me collaborate and learn from my peers. For example, I for the first time, learned how to edit videos using iMovie which Yiyang, my team member, helped me understand and use.
My initial wireframe was a lot different than the website I have in the end. Initially, I wanted to create a one page website and did not think much about interactivity, however, along tha way, I realised the importance of engagement, readibility, and interactivity for a website on top of the need to create high-quality content. I slowly made changes to fulfill these important aspects so i divided my site into several pages rather than a single page. I also changed how the headings looked and added spaces for text to appear and engage the user. I also added a header that always hovers on top of the site and also added contact information and about us to give the video more context.
My goal was to create a website that I personally as well as others would enjoy scrolling through if it was any website on the internet. In the beginning, it was hard to implement and my website looked too simple/visually unappealing. However, constantly working through it made the site look prettier, and more engaging. I was able to present my concept and story in a more interactive way and the site is now more of an experience than just a single page. Therefore, I am more than satisfied keeping in mind that this was my first time creating a website. One thing I feel I could have improved was javascript - I believe I did not give myself enough time to acquaint myself with the different things I can do with JS which is why I could not add as many interactions as I would have liked. However, I want to continue learning web development and I found this first experience very fun and helpful.
