            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                The thirty minute film festival is a challenge that was offered to my Communications Lab class at New York University Abu Dhabi. For this challenge, all students were split into groups
                of three. Then, we were given exactly 30 minutes to make a film. That means 30 minutes to come up with a video idea, shoot the video, and edit it. That is when my team
                and I decided to document the lives of our furry friends, the NYUAD cats.

                New York University Abu Dhabi, located on the beautiful Saadiyat Island in Abu Dhabi, UAE, is known for many things among which is its incredible campus.
                One of the best features of this huge campus is its adorable Campus Cats. Yes, NYUAD is home to dozens of cats. You will find these cute, furry creatures everywhere you go, be it outside the dining hall,
                on the highline, or even inside the engineering division. And they will surely brighten up your day. Often, we wonder, what goes in the minds of these cats?
                So, in this video, we decided to present our version of what these cats might say if we could talk to them!
